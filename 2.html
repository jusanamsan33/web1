  <h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>
    CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a "programming language" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites.

    This course covers it all - we start at the very basics (What is CSS? How does it work? How do you use it)? and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. And we do this by showing both practical examples as well as the theory behind it.
